    <h2>about me:</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Jacob Maier but feel free to call me Jake. I'm currently enrolled in Epicodus' Full-Stack Web Development program Full time to learn the skill that I will need to know
      to enter the Tech industry and become a full time developer. There's still much to learn but I'm confident that with hard work it will pay off in the end. I cant't wait to enter 
      an industry that I've wanted to be a part of since I was younger and I'm grateful to have the opportunity to pursue my passion with the help of my family and the staff here at epicodus.

    <h2><em>background</em></h2>
    <p>I've always had a passion for technology and what you can accomplish with it. I enjoy having diverse skillset that when you finish a project you can look at what you've built and feel proud of what you've done. I've spent most of my life as a builder helping my family with running a construction company where I'm from originally in central Oregon. After years of hard work having paid off, I'm ready to take the next step in life to change careers and I couldn't be more excited.</p>
