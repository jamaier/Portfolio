      <h2>About <span id="about">Me</span>:</h2>
      <p>
        My name is <span class="name">Jacob Maier</span> but feel free to call me Jake. I'm currently enrolled in
        <em class="name">Epicodus'</em> Full-Stack Web Development program Full time to learn the skill that I will need
        to know
        to enter the Tech industry and become a <strong>full time developer</strong>. There's still much to learn but
        I'm confident that
        with hard work it will pay off in the end. I cant't wait to enter
        an industry that I've wanted to be a part of since I was younger and I'm grateful to have the opportunity to
        pursue my passion with the help of my family and the staff here at epicodus.

    <h2 class="name"><em>Background</em></h2>
    <p>I've always had a passion for technology and what you can accomplish with it. I enjoy having diverse skillset
      that when you finish a project you can look at what you've built and feel proud of what you've done. I've spent
      most of my life as a builder helping my family with running a construction company where I'm from originally in
      central Oregon. After years of hard work having paid off, I'm ready to take the next step in life to change
      careers and I couldn't be more excited.</p>
